# Intro

The files in this repo can be used to tag text corpora with parts-of-speech (POS) or named-entity (NER) information. In python, different scripts use different tools such as the Natural Language Toolkit 
[(NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/), [spaCy](https://spacy.io), and [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) have been used to give users flexibility in the format and focus of their outputs. In terms of accuracy, huggingface is the best, 
and also the only one to easily provide for multi-token entities. The R script uses 
only spaCy due to ease of use.  You can contact [srcc-support@stanford.edu](mailto:srcc-supportt@stanford.edu) and ask for Brad Rittenhouse if you aren't sure which script fits your workflow.
